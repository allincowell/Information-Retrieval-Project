# Information Retrieval Project

This repo contains the Information Retrieval Project done in my undergrad at IIT-KGP.

## Overview

The project consists of 2 parts: Part A, and Part B.
Part A consists of 2 tasks whereas Part B consists of 1 task.

The details for each of the tasks have also been added in the repo.


## Part A (Task 1)

It involved building an Inverted Index, Query Processing and Boolean Retrieval.


## Part A (Task 2)

Using the inverted index built before, TF-IDF vectorization is done followed by evaluation w.r.t the gold-standard list of documents.


## Part B

Recall of the system is improved by adding Relevance Feedback via Rocchio's Algorithm.
Also, words were identified from pseudo relevant documents that are closer to the query.
